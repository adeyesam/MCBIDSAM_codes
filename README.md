![graphic caption](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9427664-7758-4fe4-88b0-4de79627d9fb)

This repository contains MATLAB codes for algorithms developed for building mass-constrained sparse algebraic models from noisy data (Adeyemo and Bhattacharyya 2025). These algorithms build on the BIDSAM algorithm proposed in our previous work and the codes follow similar format. Please refer to the [BIDSAM repository](https://github.com/adeyesam/BIDSAM_Codes) for detailed guide on how to begin with the BIDSAM algorithm.
The codes are presented here in two categories for steady state and dynamic model building. In each folder are codes for each of _Algorithms I_ and _II_ proposed in our work as well as sample datasets for trying out those codes. Please feel free to reach out for any clarifications in making the best use of the codes
